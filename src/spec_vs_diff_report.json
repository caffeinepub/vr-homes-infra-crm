  "summary": "The diff focuses on frontend startup/performance stabilization (lazy loading, conditional startup queries, reduced retries) and adds a mainnet deployment runbook plus a production deployment logs template. However, it does not provide evidence of an actual successful mainnet deployment, completion of the post-deploy verification checklist, or populated deployment logs with commands/output and final canister IDs.",

      "requirement": "Perform a production (Internet Computer mainnet) deployment for Version 16 so the application is reachable and usable on the production URL, including deploying/upgrading both backend and frontend canisters as needed.",
      "reason": "The diff contains documentation/runbooks and frontend changes, but no evidence of an executed mainnet deployment, no backend/frontend canister install/upgrade results, and no production URL/canister IDs demonstrating the app is live.",
